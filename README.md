# Managed DirectX Bingo Caller

What do you do when your big engagement party in Japan has a game of bingo planned? Well, you could draw numbers out of a hat, or pay for some second-rate software to do it. Or you could grab an open-source Managed DirectX library and write your own animation system for flinging numbers up onto the screen in style! 

## Disclaimer

Like all my personal projects this was done extremely quickly and no time was spent designing it for re-use or readability. Nevertheless, it may be useful for someone.

## Acknowledgement

I used an open-source library by Chad Vernon and the license for that is in the source files under the 'lib' directory.
